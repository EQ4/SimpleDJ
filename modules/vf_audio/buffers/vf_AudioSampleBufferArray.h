/** 
  An array of movable pointers to existing audio buffers.

  This simple class wraps an already existing array of pointers to
  multi-channel audio data. Provided functions can move the pointers back and
  forth as a group, making certain forms of code that manipulate audio buffers
  more concise. Type conversions to and from AudioSampleBuffer allow seamless,
  intuitive usage.

  All constructors and assignments leave the array pointing to already
  existing memory, none of these functions create new buffers. All arrays will
  point to the same sample data or storage as the objects they were
  constructed from.

  @tparam Channels The number of channels in the array of pointers,
                    default to 2 (stereo).
